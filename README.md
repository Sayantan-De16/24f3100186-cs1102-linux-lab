Hello!
My name is Sayantan De, and I am a student of the IIT Madras BS in Electronic Systems program.
Currently, I am learning Linux and Git.
I really enjoy learning about the Linux shell and its various uses.
In my free time, I like to explore new technologies and work on personal coding projects.
